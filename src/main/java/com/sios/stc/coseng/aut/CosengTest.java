/**
 * The Class CosengRunner. This is the class that each TestNG class under test
 * must extend to access the appropriate web driver at the requested depth of
 * parallelism. This class provides convenience methods to access the available
 * web driver and its derived objects such as Actions and JavascriptExecutor as
 * well as manage Selenium WebElements as objects for the level of parallelism.
 * <b>Note:</b> Call these methods from within test class methods.
 * <b>Caution:</b> Unless you manage the test context, calling these methods
 * outside of the TestNG test class methods will have unintended consequences.
